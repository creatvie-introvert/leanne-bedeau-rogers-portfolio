# Leanne Bedeau-Rogers Portfolio
[**Live Link** ](https://creatvie-introvert.github.io/leanne-bedeau-rogers-portfolio)
## Introduction
Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Leanne Bedeau-Rogers, a front-end developer currently expanding into full-stack development. This site was created to showcase my technical skills, design sensibilities, and growing body of work.

Built with semantic HTML, custom CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, the portfolio is designed to be lightweight, accessible, and fully responsive. It serves as a central hub where potential clients, employers, and collaborators can view my latest projects and get in touch.

As I continue to develop my skills, the site will evolve to reflect new technologies, frameworks, and full-stack capabilities.

## User Experience (UX)
The portfolio site is designed with a user-first mindset, ensuring smooth navigation, responsive design, and accessible content across all devices. It focuses on clarity, speed, and simplicity — making it easy for potential clients, employers, and collaborators to explore my work and get in touch.

### User Stories
As a freelance client:
- I want to view examples of past work so I can assess the developer's skills.
- I want to understand what services are offered and how to contact the developer easily.
- I want the site to be visually professional, responsive, and easy to navigate on any device.

As a potential employer:
- I want to see evidence of clean, maintainable code and modern web practices.
- I want to learn about the developer’s background, skill set, and career goals.
- I want access to both live projects and code repositories for deeper review.

As a returning visitor:
- I want to quickly identify new or updated projects.
- I want the interface to be familiar and easy to use.

As the developer (site owner):
- I want a portfolio that reflects my current skill level while leaving space to grow.
- I want the structure to allow future expansion for backend projects or a blog.
- I want the site to be fast, accessible, and optimised for SEO and performance.

## Design
The visual design of this portfolio site reflects a balance between professionalism and creativity. It uses a dark, minimalist aesthetic with subtle green accents to convey focus, modernity, and individuality. The layout is clean, mobile-first, and optimised for legibility and user flow. Each design choice is intentional — guiding users toward key sections like projects and contact without overwhelming them.

### Colour Scheme
The portfolio uses a bold, dark theme accented by a vibrant periwinkle blue. This palette balances high contrast for readability with a modern, tech-forward aesthetic. It ensures visual clarity, consistency, and strong focus on key interactive elements like buttons and links.

The colour palette was selected using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/), and refined based on accessibility testing with [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

| Element               | Colour           | Hex Code   |
|-----------------------|------------------|------------|
| Background            | Black            | `#000000`  |
| Primary Text          | White            | `#FFFFFF`  |
| Accent / Buttons      | Light Blue-Violet| `#8890FF`  |
| Card Backgrounds      | Charcoal         | `#393D47`  |
| Secondary Text        | Cool Gray         | `#CED0CE`  |
| Borders               | Deep Gray         | `#2C2C2C`  |
| Hover Effects         | Indigo            | `#4B53C2`  |
| Box Shadows           | Accent Glow (25% opacity) | `rgba(136, 144, 255, 0.25)` |
| Active States         | Bright Periwinkle | `#7C83F0`  |
| Inactive States       | Muted Gray        | `#767676`  |

This palette supports a visually cohesive experience within a dark interface, ensuring high contrast, clear hierarchy, and strong visual focus on interactive components. All colours were selected with accessibility and brand consistency in mind.

### Typography
The site uses a clean, modern type pairing to support readability, visual hierarchy, and consistency across devices.

- **Headers:** Archivo — a bold, geometric sans-serif font that gives the layout structure and impact.
- **Body Text:** Inter — a highly legible font designed for digital interfaces, chosen for its readability at all sizes.

Both fonts are sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and imported via the stylesheet for performance and consistency. Font sizes follow a responsive, mobile-first scale based on content hierarchy.

| Use Case         | Font     | Style             | Size Example |
|------------------|----------|-------------------|--------------|
| Hero Heading     | Archivo  | Bold              | 56px         |
| Section Headings | Archivo  | Bold              | 48px         |
| Subheadings      | Archivo  | Medium            | 24px         |
| Body Text        | Inter    | Regular           | 16px         |
| Buttons          | Inter    | Semi-bold         | 24px         |
| Captions         | Inter    | Italic            | 14px         |
| Tags             | Inter    | Medium Uppercase  | 8px          |

Typography is set with accessibility in mind, maintaining clear line height, contrast, and responsive scaling for all screen sizes.

### Imagery
Imagery is used intentionally throughout the portfolio to support content without overwhelming the user interface. Clean project thumbnails help visually differentiate work, while subtle icons and vector illustrations enhance the design's clarity and rhythm.

All images are optimised for web performance using appropriate file formats and compression. SVGs are used where possible for scalability and crisp rendering across screen sizes. Visual consistency is maintained through a limited colour palette and uniform styling, ensuring alignment with the overall dark aesthetic.

Alt attributes are included on all images to support screen readers and improve accessibility. As new projects are added, imagery will continue to reflect the tone and technical focus of the work presented.

## Features
This portfolio has been built with a focus on clean design, responsive layout, and accessibility. It currently includes the essential features needed to present my work and skills professionally, with future enhancements planned to improve interactivity, scalability, and user engagement. Below is a breakdown of the features currently implemented, followed by planned improvements for future versions.
